        <h2>How I Accomplished My Tasks</h2>

        <h3>Frontend Web Development Project 📖</h3>
        <p>The project revolved around a rating-giving page consisting of two web pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A page to select the desired rating and submit it.</li>
            <li>A "Thank you" page where users can view the rating they gave, accompanied by a gratitude message.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can check out a sample project at the following link:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="rating"
                    href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI">Interactive
