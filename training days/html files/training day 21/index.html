        <h2>1. Started with Sports Project in Ionic - React</h2>
        <p>
            🚀 Embarked on a new project using Ionic and React to develop a Sports application. Ionic framework provides
            a
            seamless cross-platform experience, and combining it with React allows me to build dynamic and interactive
            user
            interfaces for the sports project.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Start Learning Backend</h2>
        <p>
            📚 Taking the next step in my learning journey, I have begun delving into backend development. Learning
            backend
            technologies and frameworks will enable me to build robust server-side applications, handle databases, and
            implement complex functionalities in my projects.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Writing a Blog 📖</h2>
        <p>Writing a blog has become a regular and rewarding experience for me. Feel free to read this blog and
            provide
            your valuable
            feedback! 😊</p>

        <h2>Time Spent ⏳</h2>
        <p>
            I dedicated approximately 8 hours and 45 minutes to training on the 20th day, delving into React and Redux
            to
            enhance my front-end development skills.

                    with Node.js to
                    handle data storage and retrieval. Also, implemented API requests to interact with the backend
                    efficiently.

                    📖 Made significant progress on the Ionic Sports Meet App project by creating essential pages,
                    including Sign Up,
                    Login, and Verification pages. These pages are crucial for user authentication and account
                    management in the app.
