        <h1>Let's Begin with the Journey of Training Days of Writing Blogs - Day 9 üìñ</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>9th Day of Training</h2>
        <p>Today, I started a new project and completed that project upto frontend part.
            This project was too lengthy and hard to complete in a day the frontend design and small-small things will
            take much time.

        <h2>How I Accomplished My Tasks</h2>

        <h3>Dictionary-web-app--Project üìñ</h3>
        <p>The project focused on Fetching a word's data from API:</p>

        <p>You can check out a sample project at the following link:</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h2>1. Array and Object Destructuring, Spread Operators üöÄ</h2>
        <p>Explored the concepts of array and object destructuring, as well as the usage of spread operators in
            JavaScript.
            These features provide convenient ways to manipulate and work with arrays and objects.</p>
        <p>Array destructuring allows assigning array elements to individual variables, enabling concise and readable
            code.</p>
        <p>Object destructuring enables extracting values from an object and assigning them to variables with the same
            names as the object's properties.</p>
        <p>The spread operator (denoted by `...`) expands arrays and objects, providing a concise way to merge arrays,
            clone objects, or create new data structures.</p>
        <p>These concepts enhance code clarity and enable more efficient manipulation of arrays and objects, improving
            overall development productivity.</p>

        <h2>2. Started a new project (Dictionary-web-app--Project)</h2>
        <p>I completed the project upto Frontend part and also start work of Backend</p>

        <p>Challenges encountered during this process included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding axios to fetch data to the project</li>
            <li>Adding frontend button designs was hectic</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I built:</p>

        <h2>Time Spent</h2>
        <p>I dedicated approximately 9 hours and 20 minutes approx. to training on the first day. I used Toggl, a time
            tracking
            tool recommended by my mentor, <strong>Lakshay</strong>. You can also use it (<a
