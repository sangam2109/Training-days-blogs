        <h2>How I Accomplished My Tasks</h2>

        <h3>Frontend Web Development Project üìñ</h3>
        <p>The project focused on creating a card details page with two web pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A page for selecting and submitting card details</li>
            <li>A "Thank you" page where users can view the rating they gave, accompanied by a gratitude message</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can check out a sample project at the following link:</p>
        <ul>

        <h3>1. Started a new project (Interactive Card Project)</h3>
        <p>Today, I started working on the general layout and design of the project. The functional part is still
            pending.</p>

        <p>Challenges encountered during this process included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing complex CSS to ensure responsiveness</li>
            <li>Adding JavaScript functions using event listeners</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I built:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A page for selecting the desired rating and submitting it</li>
            <li>A "Thank you" page where users can view the rating they gave, accompanied by a gratitude message</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h4>2. Made a tic-tac-toe-game</h4>
        <p>I made a tic-tac-toe-game for just practicing javascript.</p>

        <h4>3. Writing a Blog üìñ</h4>
        <p>Writing a blog has become a regular experience for me. Feel free to read this blog and provide your valuable

        <h2>Time Spent</h2>
        <p>I dedicated approximately 7 hours and 45 minutes approx. to training on the first day. I used Toggl, a time
            tracking
            tool recommended by my mentor, <strong>Lakshay</strong>. You can also use it (<a
                href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>) ‚è≥</p>
