        <h1>Let's Begin with the Journey of Training Days of Writing Blogs - Day 3 📖</h1>
        <hr>

        <h2>3rd Day of Training</h2>
        <p>This day was filled with struggles as I delved into media queries. I watched some YouTube videos recommended
            by my mentor and sought inspiration from Google on how to transition from CSS <em>vh</em> and <em>vw</em>
            (viewport size properties) to <em>em</em> and <em>rem</em> properties guided by mentor. This enabled me to
            achieve a fully
            responsive design. Additionally, I incorporated JavaScript into the code, refactored its logic, and had a
            fruitful discussion with my mentor, <strong>Lakshay</strong>, on Google Meet. 😊</p>

        <h4>During our conversation, he enlightened me on several key topics:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>The drawbacks of using viewports in my project.</strong></li>
            <li>He provided constructive feedback on design issues and suggested effective solutions.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Our conversation was enlightening, and I gained valuable insights from him. 💡</p>

        <h2>How I Accomplished My Tasks</h2>

        <h3>Frontend Web Development Project 📖</h3>
        <p>The project revolved around a rating-giving page consisting of two web pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A page to select the desired rating and submit it.</li>
            <li>A "Thank you" page where users can view the rating they gave, accompanied by a gratitude message.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>You can check out a sample project at the following link:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="rating"
                    href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI">Interactive
                    Rating Component</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>1. Enhance the Design of the Project</h3>
        <p>I meticulously reviewed and corrected the techniques used, resulting in a responsive design achieved through
            the use of <b>rem</b>, <b>border-box</b>, media queries, and more.</p>

        <p>Challenges encountered during this process included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Implementing complex CSS to ensure responsiveness.
            <li>Implementing complex CSS to ensure
                responsiveness.</li>
            <li>Adding JavaScript functions using event listeners.</li>
            <li>Overcoming frustration while addressing responsiveness issues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I built:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>A page to select the desired rating and submit it.</li>
            <li>A "Thank you" page where users can view the rating they gave, accompanied by a gratitude message.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>2. Enhance the Functionality of the Project</h4>
        <p>Using my knowledge of data structures and algorithms, I cracked the code by exploring online resources.</p>

        <h4>3. Started Learning JavaScript</h4>
        <p>I watched YouTube videos (CodewithHarry) and relied on Google search to gain a better understanding of
            JavaScript.</p>

        <h4>4. Writing a Blog 📖</h4>

        <h2>Time Spent</h2>
        <p>I dedicated approximately 8 hours and 30 minutes to training. I used Toggl, a time tracking
            tool recommended by my mentor, <strong>Lakshay</strong>. You can also use it (<a
