        <h2>19th Day of Training</h2>
        <p>Today, I continued learning ReactJs from an excellent Udemy course in JavaScript (JSX) . Learnt the basics of
            <strong>Redux</strong> and <strong>Redux Toolkit</strong> .

        <h2>1. Start Learning React Js from Course</h2>
        <p>I embarked on the exciting journey of learning React JS from the <strong>Udemy Modern React Course with
                Redux</strong>,
            which was highly recommended and provided by my <strong>mentor</strong>.</p>
        <h3>Redux</h3>
        <p>
            Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, particularly useful in managing state in complex
            React applications. It helps in maintaining a centralized global state, making it easier to manage data
            across
            components and ensuring consistent behavior throughout the app. Redux follows a unidirectional data flow and
            encourages the use of pure functions to handle state changes, making debugging and testing more manageable.
        </p>
        <p>
            To get started with Redux in a React project, you need to install the following npm packages:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
            npm install redux react-redux
          </code></pre>
        <p>
            The <strong>redux</strong> package provides the core functionality of Redux, while
            <strong>react-redux</strong>
            offers
            bindings between Redux and React, making it easier to connect components to the Redux store.
        </p>


        <div>
            <h2>Redux Toolkit</h2>
            <p>
                Redux Toolkit is the official recommended way to write Redux logic. It provides a set of utility
                functions that
                simplify common Redux use cases and boilerplate code, making it easier to set up and maintain a Redux
                store.
                With
                Redux Toolkit, you can use the <code>createSlice</code> function to define Redux slices, which
                automatically
                generate
                action creators and reducers for you, reducing the manual work involved in writing actions and reducers
                separately.
            </p>
            <p>
                To use Redux Toolkit in your project, install the package as follows:
            </p>
            <pre><code>
            npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
          </code></pre>
            <p>
                By adopting Redux Toolkit, you can write more concise and readable Redux code, thereby improving the
                overall
                development experience.
            </p>

            <h2>2. Improved Layout and added Welcome page in Todo-app-react-web-app</h2>
            <p>I optimized the code and enhanced the quality of media queries in my Todo-react project. üöÄ</p>

            <h2>3. Writing a Blog üìñ</h2>
            <p>Writing a blog has become a regular and rewarding experience for me. Feel free to read this blog and
                provide
                your valuable
                feedback! üòä</p>
            <hr>

            <h2>Time Spent</h2>
            <p>I dedicated approximately 8 hours and 10 minutes to training on the first day. I used Toggl, a time
                tracking
                tool recommended by my mentor, <strong>Lakshay</strong>. You can also use it (<a
                    href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>) ‚è≥</p>
