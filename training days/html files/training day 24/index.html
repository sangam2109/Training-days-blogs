        <h2>1. Fixed bugs in UserDetails page 🐛</h2>
        <p>
            During the development process, I thoroughly reviewed the UserDetails page and successfully addressed
            various bugs
            and issues. By careful debugging and testing, I ensured that the page now functions as intended, providing
            users
            with a smooth and error-free experience.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Added Dashboard Page structure 📈</h2>
        <p>
            As part of the project enhancement, I designed and implemented the Dashboard Page structure. The Dashboard
            will
            provide users with an informative and visually appealing overview of important data and analytics related to
            the
            athletic meet. This addition aims to enhance the user experience and help administrators make data-driven
            decisions.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Continued work on SRS document 📝</h2>
        <p>
            The Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is an essential part of the project development. I
            have
            continued to work diligently on the SRS, ensuring that all the necessary details and requirements are
            thoroughly
            documented. The SRS serves as a comprehensive guide for the project's development and ensures alignment with
            stakeholders' expectations.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Some information still left to include in SRS 🚧</h2>
        <p>
            While making substantial progress on the SRS document, I am actively working on gathering and including all
            the
            relevant information. This ongoing process involves collaborating with stakeholders to ensure that the
            document is
            complete, accurate, and captures all the essential aspects of the project.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Writing a Blog 📖</h2>
        <p>Writing a blog has become a regular and rewarding experience for me. Feel free to read this blog and
            provide
            your valuable
            feedback! 😊</p>

        <h2>Time Spent ⏳</h2>
        <p>
            I dedicated approximately 8 hours and 15 minutes to training on the 20th day, delving into React and Redux
            to
            enhance my front-end development skills.
