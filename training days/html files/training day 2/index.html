        <h2>How I Accomplished My Tasks</h2>

        <h3> Frontend Web Development Project &#x1F4D6;</h3>
        <p>Basically, it was a rating-giving page with 2 web pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To select which rating you want to give and click on the submit button</li>
            <li>To view the "Thank you" page where you can see the rating you gave and a thank you message.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To view a sample project check the link given below-</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <a class="rating"
                    href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI">Rating
                    Webpage project for beginners</a>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>

        <h3>1. Compare my design with the sample design </h3>
        <p>I just compared it by reviewing and correcting techniques.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>I found some color mistakes</li>
            <li>Some mistakes in sizes</li>
            <li>Heavy mistakes in responsiveness</li>
        </ol>

        <p>Complexities occurred during:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Adding complex CSS for responsiveness</li>
            <li>Adding some functions of JavaScript using event listeners</li>
            <li>Responsiveness of pages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I built:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To select which rating you want to give and click on the submit button</li>
            <li>To view the "Thank you" page where you can see the rating you gave and a thank you message.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To view my built project check the link given below-</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>2. Learn media queries in a better way</h4>
        <p>Just took guidance from my mentor <b>Lakshay</b> and started watching a YouTube video for reference. <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn-DQCifeQQ">Link to the video</a></p>

        <h4>3. Adding Basic JavaScript</h4>
        <p>Just watched some YouTube videos and used Google search to help me understand and implement it.</p>

        <h4>4. Writing a Blog &#x1F4D6;</h4>
        <p>It has become a routine experience for me to write a blog. You can read this blog and give me your review
            &#x1F609;</p>

        <h2>Time Spent</h2>
        <p>I spent 11:43:48 hours/day on the first day of training. I used Toggl time tracker suggested by my mentor,
            <strong>Lakshay</strong>. You can also use it (<a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>) &#x23F0;</p>
