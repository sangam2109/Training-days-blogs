        <h2>1. 📚 Learned about state-management in Reactjs. <span style="font-size: larger;">👨‍💻</span> Man
            Technologist</h2>
        <p>
            In my learning journey, I focused on understanding state-management in React.js. State management is crucial
            for
            efficiently managing the state of a React application and handling data flow across components. I explored
            various
            state-management approaches and libraries to improve the scalability and maintainability of my projects. As
            I delved
            deeper, I also learned about different state management patterns and best practices.
        </p>

        <h2>2. 🔍 Explored jotai & easy-peasy.</h2>
        <p>
            As part of my exploration, I delved into two popular state-management libraries for React: jotai and
            easy-peasy.
            Jotai provides a simpler and more flexible way to manage state in React applications, while easy-peasy
            offers a more
            opinionated and easy-to-use solution. By exploring these libraries, I aimed to identify their strengths and
            weaknesses and understand how they can benefit different types of projects.
        </p>

        <h2>3. ✅ Successfully added state-management using easy-peasy in
            SportsMeet2024.</h2>
        <p>
            After evaluating different state-management options, I integrated easy-peasy into the SportsMeet2024
            project.
            Easy-peasy provided an intuitive and efficient way to manage the state of the application, improving its
            performance
            and maintainability. The integration involved refactoring existing code and organizing the application's
            state in a
            more structured manner. With easy-peasy, the application now has a robust state-management system that
            enhances the
            overall user experience.
        </p>

        <h2>4.🐛 Fixed some bugs from previous pages.</h2>
        <p>
            In addition to state-management improvements, I dedicated time to bug fixing in the SportsMeet2024
            application. I
            thoroughly reviewed the application, identified and addressed various bugs and issues, and ensured that the
            user
            interface and functionalities work as intended. The bug fixing process helps maintain a stable and reliable
            application for users, providing them with a seamless experience.

        <h2>5. Writing a Blog 📖</h2>
        <p>Writing a blog has become a regular and rewarding experience for me. Feel free to read this blog and
            provide
            your valuable
            feedback! 😊</p>

        <h2>Time Spent ⏳</h2>
        <p>
            I dedicated approximately 8 hours and 15 minutes to training on the 20th day, delving into React and Redux
            to
            enhance my front-end development skills.
