        <h1>Let's Begin with the Journey of Training Days of Writing Blogs - Day 1 &#x1F4D6;</h1>

        <h2>1st Day of Training</h2>
        <p>As usual, everyone is excited for a new schedule to come, new things to learn, and I am also excited for the same. I am doing my training at a company named <strong>RYAZ</strong>. It is my first experience working with mentors of the company.</p>
        <p>I had already heard about the company that mentors are too supportive, but I still had some instincts of getting a hard and strict mentor. But luckily, I got a mentor named <strong>Lakshay Brother</strong>. He was too supportive and helped me to polish my skills in web development. He gave me the authority to be not too formal and just ask my query as if he's my brother.</p>
        <p>It was a good start of the day &#x1F60A;</p>

        <h2>Tasks for the Day</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Learn git commands and about GitHub Pages (Already somewhat familiar with that) &#x1F4D6;</li>

            <li>Writing a daily blog &#x1F4D6;</li>

        <ol>
            <li>Learn git commands and about GitHub Pages (Already somewhat familiar with that) &#x1F4D6;</li>
            <li>Accomplish a frontend web development project &#x1F4D6;</li>
            <li>Writing a daily blog &#x1F4D6;</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>How I Accomplished My Tasks</h2>

        <h3>1. Learn Git Commands and About GitHub Pages &#x1F4D6;</h3>
        <p>For this, I already had some knowledge of GitHub, and GitBash is already installed. I used them many times for my previous projects. I referred to some YouTube videos for a fast revision. You can also refer to them. They are good and easy to understand. Watch at 1.5x speed by <em>Anuj Bhaiya</em>.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/uaeKhfhYE0U">Link for learning Git commands</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://youtu.be/4eMnz8VbgyM">For GitHub Pages</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Frontend Web Development Project &#x1F4D6;</h3>
        <p>Basically, it was a rating-giving page with 2 web pages:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To select which rating you want to give and click on the submit button</li>
            
            <li>To view the "Thank you" page where you can see the rating you gave and a thank you message.</li>
             
        </ol>
        <p>To view a sample project check the link given below-
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a class="rating"href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-rating-component-koxpeBUmI">Rating Webpage project for begineer</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Complexities occurred during:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Sometimes in basic CSS</li>
            <li>Responsiveness of pages</li>
            <li>Functionality using JavaScript</li>
        </ul>
        <p>What I built:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To select which rating you want to give and click on the submit button</li>
            <li>To view the "Thank you" page where you can see the rating you gave and a thank you message.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>To view my builted project check the link given below-
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <a class="rating"href="https://sangam2109.github.io/Frontend-rating-project/">Rating Webpage project for begineer by Sangam Arora</a>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <h3>3. Writing a Blog &#x1F4D6;</h3>
        <p>It's my first experience of writing a blog. You can read this blog and give me your review &#x1F609;</p>

        <h2>Time Spent</h2>
        <p>I spent 8-9 hours on the first day of training. I used Toggl time tracker suggested by my mentor, <strong>Lakshay</strong>. You can also use it (<a href="https://toggl.com/">Toggl</a>) &#x23F0;</p>

        <h2>End of the Day</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>All git commands and GitHub Pages (done) &#x1F389;</li>
            <li>Blog Writing Done</li>
            <li>Basic HTML and CSS part of the Rating page project (done) &#x1F389;</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Oh ho sorry &#x1F602; I wrote it in the wrong format. The correct format is-</h3>
        <b><h2>EOD 23rd July 2023-</h2></b>
        <ol>
            <li>All git commands and GitHub Pages &#x1F60D;</li>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>First-day experience is too good with so much to learn. First-time writing a blog and done with my first own project &#x1F389;</p>
