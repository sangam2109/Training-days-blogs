    <h1>Welcome to My Blog!</h1>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Myself Sangam Arora, hailing from the small town of Ahmedgarh in District Malerkotla, Punjab. I am a B.Tech Computer Science student at Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College. Being a college topper and excelling in academics, I developed a passion for learning new technologies.
        After my second year of college, I pursued training at a company named RYAZ with the guidance of my college teacher, <b>Kapil Sir</b>, and the alumnus of GNE College, my super senior, and a member of Ryaz Foundation, <b>Mr. Amanjot Singh</b>.

    <h2>Why I Started This Initiative</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>To establish consistency in my work during my training days.</li>
        <li>To enhance my writing and creativity skills.</li>
        <li>To express my feelings through words, which can also serve as a helpful resource for newbies.</li>
        <li><strong>Fun fact &#x1F602;:</strong> I also use HTML and CSS in my blog, which helps improve my knowledge of web development.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Long Will It Go?</h2>
    <p>It's hard to say for certain, but I'm committed to making it a regular activity, just like eating regularly! üçΩÔ∏è</p>
